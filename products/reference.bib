	abstract = {The development of next-generation influenza vaccines that elicit strain-transcendent immunity against both seasonal and pandemic viruses is a key  public health goal. Targeting the evolutionarily conserved epitopes on the stem of  influenza's major surface molecule, hemagglutinin, is an appealing prospect, and  novel vaccine formulations show promising results in animal model systems. However,  studies in humans indicate that natural infection and vaccination result in limited  boosting of antibodies to the stem of HA, and the level of stem-specific antibody  elicited is insufficient to provide broad strain-transcendent immunity. Here, we use  mathematical models of the humoral immune response to explore how pre-existing  immunity affects the ability of vaccines to boost antibodies to the head and stem of  HA in humans, and, in particular, how it leads to the apparent lack of boosting of  broadly cross-reactive antibodies to the stem epitopes. We consider hypotheses where  binding of antibody to an epitope: (i) results in more rapid clearance of the  antigen; (ii) leads to the formation of antigen-antibody complexes which inhibit B  cell activation through Fcγ receptor-mediated mechanism; and (iii) masks the epitope  and prevents the stimulation and proliferation of specific B cells. We find that  only epitope masking but not the former two mechanisms to be key in recapitulating  patterns in data. We discuss the ramifications of our findings for the development  of vaccines against both seasonal and pandemic influenza.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Concerns about influenza vaccine effectiveness in older adults and the role of influenza strains encountered earlier in life led to this study. METHODS:  Antibody responses against antigens in the 2011-2012 influenza vaccine at 21 days  post vaccination were analyzed in 264 individuals aged 50-80 years. At Days 0 and  21, sera were tested for hemagglutination-inhibition titers against these vaccine  strains and at Day 0 against a panel of 15 historical seasonal strains.: RESULTS:  The proportions of participants with seroprotective titers ≥1:40 to the vaccine  strains at Days 0 and 21, respectively, were 37\% and 66\% for A(H1N1) and 28\% and 63\%  for A(H3N2). An increasing number of responses ≥1:40 against historical strains was  associated with seroprotective responses after vaccination among participants with a  titer{\textless}1:40 at Day 0 for A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) vaccine strains (P{\textless}0.01). In  multivariable regression analyses among those with Day 0 titer{\textless}1:40, after  controlling for age, sex, race, site and diabetes, Day 21 titers ≥ 1:40 for the  vaccine A strains were significantly more likely as the number of seroprotective  responses against historical strains increased (A(H1N1) odds ratio [OR] = 1.41, 95\%  confidence interval [CI] = 1.09-1.82 and A(H3N2) OR = 1.32, 95\% CI = 1.07-1.62). The  likelihood of seroconversion was significantly higher with an increasing number of  responses to historical strains for A(H3N2) only (OR = 1.24, 95\% CI = 1.01-1.52).  Seroconversion was significantly less likely as Day 0 vaccine strain titers  increased. CONCLUSIONS: Seroprotective titers after influenza vaccination increased  as the number of responses to historical strains increased.},

	abstract = {Seasonal variation in the age distribution of influenza A cases suggests that factors other than age shape susceptibility to medically attended infection. We ask  whether these differences can be partly explained by protection conferred by  childhood influenza infection, which has lasting impacts on immune responses to  influenza and protection against new influenza A subtypes (phenomena known as  original antigenic sin and immune imprinting). Fitting a statistical model to data  from studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE), we find that primary infection  appears to reduce the risk of medically attended infection with that subtype  throughout life. This effect is stronger for H1N1 compared to H3N2. Additionally, we  find evidence that VE varies with both age and birth year, suggesting that VE is  sensitive to early exposures. Our findings may improve estimates of age-specific  risk and VE in similarly vaccinated populations and thus improve forecasting and  vaccination strategies to combat seasonal influenza.},
